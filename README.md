# docker-sqlcl
A Docker build for Oracle SQLcl. 

You will need to download Oracle SQLcl separately from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview/index.html and place it in the assets/binary directory. 

Look in re-build.sh and re-run-db.sh for example on creating a network, starting an XE container, then starting sqlcl in the same network and connecting.
